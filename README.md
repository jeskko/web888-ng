# web888-ng: new server (`web888d`) for the Web-888 SDR

A Rust server for the Web-888 receiver: its own web UI, standard SDR
protocols (HPSDR, rtl_tcp, IQ), decoders, and KiwiSDR protocol
compatibility. It runs on the stock firmware (stock or open bitstream) and
later on the open driver from [web888-ng-hw](https://github.com/jeskko/web888-ng-hw).

Status: **design phase**, see `doc/design.md`. No code yet.

keeps its original notices. Provenance rules are in `doc/design.md` §12.
